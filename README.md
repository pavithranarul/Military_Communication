One of a military's basic functions is public services to citizens. Service
delivery of this kind requires public expenditure. Hence, the military shares data and creates plans
they share via phones and two-way radio transmitters but these ways are no longer secure also
message transmission takes more time for these purposes we should overcome in new ways
through web applications to transmit messages and plans other updates these transmissions can be
covey less time also share top level to bottom level officers at a same time securely transmitted
these process we worked on our project by these process we should prevent our data from hacker
and virus attacks.
